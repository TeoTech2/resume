    Hello -- my name is Theodore Mollano. I'm a first year student of mathematics and a D1 Skier at Williams College in Williamstown, MA.

    <p>
         &alpha;: My interests in mathematics include: analysis and projective geometry. Academically, I also love learning languages; speaking German, Italian, and working on new projects
    </p>

    <p>
         &beta;: My favorite math book is Coexter: Geometry Revised (see: Geometric Duality), as well as Problems from the Book by Titu.
    </p>

    <p>
         &gamma;: Ski training, along with mathematics, is my greatest passion. Unfortunately, I have been injured this season but typically, my interests in mathematics and ski training accompany one another.
    </p>

     <p>
         &delta;: Am familiar with Python, Java, Latex, HTML, CSS, basics of Github Repos (this website was programmed on it!) and am capable of learning new methods and syntaxes
    </p>

    <p>
         &epsilon;: My goal for this year is two-fold: think about problem solving skills while developing my mathematical rigor.
    </p>
