    Hello -- my name is Theodore Mollano. I'm a first year student of mathematics at Williams College in Williamstown, MA.

    <p>
         &alpha;: My interests in mathematics include: analysis and calculus of variations. Academically, I also love learning languages; speaking German, Italian, as well as coding and creative problem solving. I am a web developer for https://gaudino.williams.edu/
    </p>

    <p>
         &beta;: My favorite math book is Coexter: Geometry Revised as well as "17 Equations that Changed the World."
    </p>

    <p>
         &gamma;: I am also very passionate about skiing and ski training. I am a d1 ski racer at williams college.
    </p>

     <p>
         &delta;: Am familiar with Python, Java, LaTex, HTML, CSS, Wolfram Language, basics of Github Repos and am capable of learning new methods and syntaxes
    </p>

    <p>
         &epsilon;: My goals for this year are two-fold: think about problem solving skills while developing my logical rigor. I would also like to learn more algorithmic style coding and begin working with c++.
